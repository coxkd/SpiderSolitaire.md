Spider solitaire is a popular card game often played on computers online or offline. As the name implies, the game is for one player only. 
There are two standard decks of cards and the player aims to organise cards into eight complete suits and remove them from the tableau. 
Cards can be dealt from the stock or moved from one column to another according to certain rules.
