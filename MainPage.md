# What is Spider Solitaire?
Spider solitaire is a popular card game often played on computers online or offline. As the name implies, the game is for one player only.

Cards can be dealt from the stock or moved from one column to another according to certain rules. For the purpose of this project, we will be exploring the computer version, Microsoft Spider Solitaire, since it is easier to explain for beginners of the famous card game.
