# What Do I Need?
To play Microsoft Spider Solitaire, all you need is a computer with a working mouse. The game can be played offline unless you want to play the
daily challenge, participate in an event, or use Xbox Live, so it is perfectly fine if you do not have internet access. You will also, of course, need the 
Spider Solitaire game from the Microsoft store, which can be downloaded for free with no in-app purchases necessary. You can find the instructions for installing
Microsoft Spider Solitaire in the [next section](https://github.com/coxkd/SpiderSolitaire.md/blob/main/Installation.md)
