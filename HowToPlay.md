# How to Play Microsoft Spider Solitaire
- The Object of the Game: The goal is to assemble 13 cards of a suit, in ascending sequence from ace through king, on top of a pile. Whenever a full suit of 13 cards is so assembled, it is lifted off and discarded from the game. The game is won if all eight suits are played out.

- Opening the Game: Using the search bar at the bottom of your screen, search "spider solitaire", and the game should be the first result. When you click on the application, it will immediately load a new game for you to start playing. You can also click "Games" if you prefer a different kind of solitaire game or want a different difficulty. 

- Basic Rules: Notice that ten piles of five cards each are dealt by rows. The first four cards of each pile are dealt face down, the top cards face up. The top card of a pile may be moved, together with all face-up cards below it that follow in ascending suit and sequence. 

  A sequence of available cards may be broken at any point by leaving some cards behind. Example: If a pile from top down shows 4, 5, 6, 7, either the first one, two, or three cards may be moved as a unit, but the 7 may not be moved until the covering three cards are removed. When all face-up cards on a pile are removed, the next card below is turned face up and becomes available. 

  A movable unit of cards may be placed either in a space or on a card of the next-higher rank to the bottom card of the unit, regardless of color or suit. Example: If the bottom card of a unit is the J, it may be moved onto any one of the four queens. A king can be moved only onto a space. Alternatively, the spaces may be filled with any movable unit. 

  When all possible or desired moves come to a standstill, the player deals another row of ten cards face up. However, before such a deal may be made, all spaces must be filled. The final deal consists of only four cards, which are placed on the first four piles. This process continues until all cards have been organized in order; this means you have won. If you get stuck and there are no further moves possible, you can choose to undo your previous moves one at a time or quit and start another game since not every game of Spider Solitaire is winnable depending on the difficulty.
